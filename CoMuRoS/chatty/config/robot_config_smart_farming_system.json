  "robot_capabilities": {
    "differential_drive_robot_with_carrier": "It can inspect things carefully. Carries bulk farming supplies like water, seeds, fertilizer, or harvested crops. Moves on flat soil paths. Equipped with GPS and a large payload compartment. Cannot manipulate objects but can follow routes to support other robots.",
    "differential_drive_robot_with_arm": "It can fix thing carefully. Performs precision tasks like planting, spraying, cutting grass, and weeding. Equipped with robotic arm, GPS, depth camera, and sensors. Can manipulate objects, place items into soil, or remove unwanted plants. CAn seed planting, localized spraying, and weed removal. can remove diseased plants or weeds if detected using visual or thermal sensors.",
    "robot_dog_with_arm": "It can carry the items to fix things. Capable of inspecting uneven terrain, reaching sloped crop areas, and assisting animals in the field. Equipped with GPS, thermal sensor, depth camera, and a robotic arm. Can assist with crop health checks, retrieve dropped tools, or help herd animals. can remove diseased plants or weeds if detected using visual or thermal sensors."
