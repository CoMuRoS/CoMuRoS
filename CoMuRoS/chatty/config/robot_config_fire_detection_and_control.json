  "robot_capabilities": {
    "drone": "Can fly and scan large areas quickly. Equipped with thermal camera, lidar, GPS, and standard camera. Suitable for fire detection, aerial surveillance, and locating hotspots. Cannot interact physically but provides crucial overview and alerts.",
    "robot_dog_with_arm": "Capable of navigating rough, hazardous terrain. It can go to a place where the fire has been set. Equipped with robotic arm, thermal and depth camera, lidar, and GPS. Can open doors, carry small fire extinguishers, and assist in basic rescue or hazard removal tasks.",
    "differential_drive_robot_with_arm": "Can move on flat or moderately rough surfaces. It can spray water. Equipped with robotic arm, thermal camera, lidar, GPS, and water spray tool. Can suppress small fires, remove objects, or deliver fire-fighting tools on-site."
