    "differential_drive_robot_with_arm_1": "Can move through store aisles, pick products from shelves, restock items, carry small loads in onboard carrier. Equipped with robotic arm, barcode scanner, camera, and GPS. Suitable for handling product retrieval, shelf reorganization, and delivery inside the store.",
    "differential_drive_robot_with_arm_2": "Can navigate narrow store spaces, restock refrigerated items, handle deliveries from storage to front counter. Equipped with robotic arm, camera, lidar, onboard carrier, and product tray. Useful for internal logistics and stocking assistance."
